This can be done on an emulator behaving like a device. The `VirtualDevice` class is useful to define such an emulator, a virtual device. Let's start by configuring a virtual device having the same parameters as `Chadoq2`. To do this, we use the `Device.to_virtual()` method that creates a virtual device from a physical one. "
