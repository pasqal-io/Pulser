    "Under the right circumstances, phase shifts can be a great way of implementing so-called *virtual-Z gates*. Let's see how these arise and how we can use them to our advantage. \n",
    "Consider an arbitrary 2x2 unitary matrix (up to a global phase) and a possible decompostion in terms of rotations around the $x$ and $z$ axes ($R_X$ and $R_Z$) of the Bloch sphere: \n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to be able to apply this transformation on our qubit states through our pulses. A pulse that is on-resonance with its target transition (i.e. has detuning $\\delta = 0$) can be described as an arbitrary rotation around an axis contained in the Bloch sphere's equator, $\\hat{n}= (\\cos \\phi, -\\sin \\phi, 0)$. From the general form of such a rotation, $R_{\\hat{n}}(\\theta) =     \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\theta}{2}  \\hat{n}\\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}\\right)$, we arrive at:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have two free parameters: the angle of rotation $\\theta$, which is determined by the integral of the amplitude waveform, and $\\phi$, the pulse's phase. Thus, we can see that a pulse is a particular case of the arbitrary single-qubit gate $U$, where $\\gamma = -\\phi$, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{\\hat{n}(\\phi)}(\\theta) = U(-\\phi, \\theta, \\phi) $$\n",

    "Now, how do we implement such a gate? In fact, to physically change the phase of the qubit's state in this reference frame with a single pulse, we would have to be able to apply a detuned pulse of zero amplitude, which is no pulse at all! Instead, what we can do is change the frame of rotation such that the phase gate is applied *virtually*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how this can be done, we first have to realise that this last phase gate is irrelevant if it is the last one applied to the qubit before it is measured - a change of the phase between the $\\sigma_z$ eigenstates will produce no change in the measurement outcome, since that occurs in the same basis. But what if it is not the last gate that we apply on this qubit? In that case, we can describe the situation as a new arbitrary gate being applied after the existent one, i.e.\n",

In this way, we go back to a situation where we have a phase gate at the end (with an updated carry $k'$). We can repeat this process until the moment we measure the qubit, at which point, as we've seen, the remaining phase gate is redundant. \n",
