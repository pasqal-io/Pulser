    "When performing quantum computations with global pulses, it might be hard to prepare the system in an arbitrary initial state. This is especially true in the XY mode, where only a global $\\sigma^x$ pulse can produce excitations whose number is otherwise conserved during free evolution. A partial solution to this problem is to utilize an SLM mask. <br>\n",
