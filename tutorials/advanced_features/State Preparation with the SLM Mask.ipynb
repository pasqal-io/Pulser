    "When performing quantum computations with global pulses, it might be hard to prepare the system in an arbitrary initial state. This is especially true in the XY mode, where only a global $\\sigma^x$ pulse can produce excitations whose number is otherwise conserved during free evolution. A partial solution to this problem is to utilize an SLM mask. <br>\n",
    "Assume a system of three qubits in XY mode is initially in state $\\left| \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow \\right\\rangle$, and that we are interested in preparing the state $\\left| \\uparrow \\downarrow \\downarrow \\right\\rangle$. Acting naively with a global $\\sigma^x$ pulse of area $\\pi$ would result in state $\\left| \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \\right\\rangle$. Using an SLM pattern, however, it is possible to detune the last two qubits away from resonance, and the same global $\\sigma^x$ pulse will produced instead the desired state $\\left| \\uparrow \\downarrow \\downarrow \\right\\rangle$. <br>\n",
