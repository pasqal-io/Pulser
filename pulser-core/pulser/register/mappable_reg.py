        This can especially be useful when building a Pulser Sequence
        with a parameter denoting qubits.

        Example:
            Let ``reg`` be a mappable register with qubit Ids "a", "b", "c"
            and "d".

            >>> qubit_map = dict(b=1, a=2, d=0)

            >>>   ["a", "b", "d", "a"])

            It returns ``[0, 1, 2, 0]``, following the qubits order of the
            mappable register, but keeping only the chosen ones.

            Then, it is possible to use these indices when building a
            sequence, typically to instanciate an array of variables
            that can be provided as an argument to ``target_index``
            and ``phase_shift_index``.

            ``qubit_map`` should be provided when building the sequence,
            to tell how to instantiate the register from the mappable register.

        Args:
            chosen_ids: IDs of the qubits that are chosen to
                map the MappableRegister
            id_list: IDs of the qubits to denote.
