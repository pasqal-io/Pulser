class Sequence:
    """A sequence of operations on a device.

    A sequence is composed by

        - The device in which we want to implement it
        - The register of qubits on which to act
        - The device's channels that are used
        - The schedule of operations on each channel


    A Sequence also supports variable parameters, which have to be obtained
    through ``Sequence.declare_variable()``. From the moment a variable is
    declared, a ``Sequence`` becomes **parametrized** and stops being built on
    the fly, instead storing the sequence building calls for later execution.
    This forgoes some specific functionalities of a "regular" ``Sequence``,
    like the ability to validate a ``Pulse`` or to draw the sequence as it is
    being built. Instead, all validation happens upon building (through
    ``Sequence.build()``), where values for all declared variables have to be
    specified and a "regular" ``Sequence`` is created and returned. By
    changing the values given to the variables, multiple sequences can be
    generated from a single "parametrized" ``Sequence``.

    Args:
        register: The atom register on which to apply the pulses. If given as
            a MappableRegister instance, the traps corrresponding to each
            qubit ID must be given when building the sequence.
        device: A valid device in which to execute the Sequence (import
            it from ``pulser.devices``).

    Note:
        The register and device do not support variable parameters. As such,
        they are the same for all Sequences built from a parametrized Sequence.

            draw_register: Whether to draw the register before the pulse
                sequence, with a visual indication (square halo) around the
                qubits masked by the SLM, defaults to False. Can't be set to
                True if the sequence is defined with a mappable register.
            draw_phase_curve: Draws the changes in phase in its own curve
                (ignored if the phase doesn't change throughout the channel).
            fig_name: The name on which to save the
                figure. If `draw_register` is True, both pulses and register
                will be saved as figures, with a suffix ``_pulses`` and
                ``_register`` in the file name. If `draw_register` is False,
                only the pulses are saved, with no suffix. If `fig_name` is
                None, no figure is saved.
            kwargs_savefig: Keywords arguments for
                ``matplotlib.pyplot.savefig``. Not applicable if `fig_name`
                is ``None``.
